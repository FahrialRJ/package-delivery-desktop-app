# Package Delivery System - Final OOP Project

This is a desktop-based package delivery system built with Python Tkinter, submitted as a final project for Object Oriented Programming course. Admin has full control over the program. This program has several features:

- Login, create new admin accounts, and manage couriers
- Add new shipments with details: Sender, receiver, dimensions, origin, destination, etc
- Automatic distance calculation using OpenStreetMap via OSRM API
- Shipping cost calculation based on distance, size, weight, and delivery type (Regular or express)
- Estimated delivery date based on delivery type and route
- Courier assignment and package status tracking
- Opens route preview in browser via OpenStreetMap
- All information can is saved locally using "data.json"

Note: Do not install or run this application from a restricted directory like "C:\Program Files" as it needs permissions to write data to "data.json". It's recommended to place the folder in "D:\" or your user directory.

This project was originally submitted and uploaded under my second GitHub account (https://github.com/RizkiEagle7). It is now included here as part of my software development portofolio.
